This is a first story of my recent life. Or maybe the such things has also happened in past.
I just find that I am very easy to fall in love with someone although I already have a lover and we love each other so much?
Once somebody get in touch with me or have some special shiny point, that will attracts me to find out what the person really is. 
I am very curious about that and I want to first search the related information by myself. 
If the person would like to tell me more about him/herself, I will fall deeper and deeper.
It is horrible to get easy to love other ones. Sometimes, when I get to know someone more, I will begin to imagine what it would be if we were together.
I love to think this kind of things although we hardly talk with each other.
Maybe I just love the feeling of fresh love or a new comer to my life. Or maybe I don't like the long term to exchange each other's heart.
